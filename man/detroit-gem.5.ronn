===============================================

## DESCRIPTION

The Gem plug-in for Detroit utilize the `gem` command line tool
to build a .gem package for a project during the standard `package`
phase.


## OPTIONS

The following options can be used in the Detroit assembly file
for defining a dnote service.

  * `gemspec` - The .gemspec file. The default looks for a `.gemspec`
     or `{name}.gemspec` file.

  * `autospec` - Setting this option to `true` will have the plug-in 
     create a gemspec using a project's metadata. Default is `false`.

  * `pkgdir` - Directory to save generated gem file. The default is `pkg/`.

  * `install` - Should the gem be installed after being generated? Default
     is `false`.


## EXAMPLES

Becuase the default options are all that is likely to be need the
common exmaple something like:

    gem:
      active: true

A fuller example might look something like this.

     gem:
       gemspec: myapp-extra.gemspec
       install: true

The above examples use the YAML-base assembly format. Assembly
files can also be Ruby-based. See Detroit documentation for more
details.
